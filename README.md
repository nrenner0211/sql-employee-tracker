## About

My assignment this week was to build a command-line application intended to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. A CMS (content management system) that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. User story below:

`AS A business owner`

`I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company`

`SO THAT I can organize and plan my business`

## Acceptance Criteria

`GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input`

`WHEN I start the application`

`THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role`

`WHEN I choose to view all departments`

`THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids`

`WHEN I choose to view all roles`

`THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role`

`WHEN I choose to view all employees`

`THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to`

`WHEN I choose to add a department`

`THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database`

`WHEN I choose to add a role`

`THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database`

`WHEN I choose to add an employee`

`THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database`

`WHEN I choose to update an employee role`

`THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database`

## Installation
